### Summary of the Game
>The game of Hare and Tortoise gives you a chance to compete in the classic story-book race. During the game you'll get to use the tactics of both the hare and the tortoise as you race to finish the game. At times you'll find that it's best to follow the rabbits lead and race as fast as you can, but at other times you might find it wise to slow down and take a more steady pace like the turtle.

>Hare and Tortoise is a fun game for the entire family that will have you strategizing to see who will defeat the other players. Give the game Hare and Tortoise a try today.
